memory tag is used to identify driver, if the driver is unloaded but the memory with this tag is still exist, then it should be destroyed, you can use this tool to identify it: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zodiacon/AllTools/master/PoolMonX.exe

driver tag is reversed in monitor, if your tag is "2345", you will see "5432" in the monitor


LIST_ENTRY is an imporatant structure in kernel code, many internal data structure have this in its field to link each other, and we can use macro `CONTAINING_RECORD` to get the real structure address with LIST_ENTRY field, we have disscussed this in https://144.one/practical-reverse-engineering-notes-part-i.html

here is an example of `CONTAINING_RECORD` usage:

```c
struct MyDataItem {
    // some data members
    LIST_ENTRY Link;
    // more data members
};

MyDataItem* GetItem(LIST_ENTRY* pEntry) {
    // address, struct(datatype), field(address)
    return CONTAINING_RECORD(pEntry, MyDataItem, Link);
}
```

cleint program use `DEVICE_OBJECT` structure talk to driver, every driver has at least one device object to represent itself


let's create a driver which can modify thread priority, here is the table of priority:

| Priority Class  | -Sat  |-2   |-1   |0(default)   |+1|+2|+Sat
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Idle  |1  |   2|3  |4 |  5 |6|15|
| Below Normal  | 1  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7 |8|15|
|   Normal|  1 |  6 |  7 |   8| 9 |10|15|
|   Above Normal| 1  |8   |9   | 10  |11  |12|15|
|   High|  1 |11   |  12 |  13 | 14 |15|15|
|   Real-time|  16 |  22 |  23 | 24  |  25|26|31|

|-|-|
|:---:|:---|
|-Sat|   THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE|
|-2|    THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST||
|-1|  THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL|
|0| THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL|
|+1|   THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL|
|+2|  THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST|
|+Sat|  THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL|

such as this code:

```c
SetPriorityClass(GetCurrentProcess(), ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS);
SetThreadPriority(GetCurrentThread(), THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL);
```
will set the Thread priority to 11, here is why it is set to 11, first call set the Process priority to `Above Normal`, which is the 4th row in the table, the second call set Thread priority to `Above Normal` which is the 5th column in the table, so is is 11 (4,5)


when we need to represent a 32bit number, we should always use ULONG, but not DWORD, because DWORD is not defined in kernel mode header files
